# Frontend Design — Groove

Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

## Stack

- **Framework**: Nuxt 4 + Vue 3 (Composition API, `<script setup>`)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 (config via `@theme` in CSS, no `tailwind.config`)
- **Components**: Nuxt UI (`UButton`, `UCard`, `UInput`, etc.)
- **Icons**: Nuxt UI icon set

## Design Thinking

Before coding any UI, commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:

1. **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
2. **Tone**: Pick a clear direction — brutally minimal, retro-futuristic, editorial/magazine, luxury/refined, playful, brutalist/raw, organic, etc.
3. **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE?

Execute with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work — the key is intentionality.

## Aesthetic Rules

- **Typography**: Choose distinctive, characterful fonts. NEVER default to Inter, Roboto, Arial, or system fonts. Pair a display font with a refined body font.
- **Color & Theme**: Commit to a cohesive palette using CSS variables / Tailwind `@theme`. Dominant colors with sharp accents > timid evenly-distributed palettes.
- **Motion**: Prioritize CSS-only animations. Focus on high-impact moments: staggered reveals, scroll-triggered effects, surprising hover states.
- **Spatial Composition**: Unexpected layouts, asymmetry, overlap, grid-breaking elements, generous negative space OR controlled density.
- **Backgrounds & Texture**: Atmosphere and depth over flat solid colors — gradient meshes, noise, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, grain overlays.

## Anti-Patterns (NEVER do this)

- Generic purple gradients on white backgrounds
- Overused font stacks (Inter, Roboto, Arial)
- Predictable card-grid layouts with no personality
- Cookie-cutter components that lack context-specific character
- Converging on the same font (e.g. Space Grotesk) across generations

## Implementation Quality

- Always use `<script setup lang="ts">` with proper TypeScript
- Use Nuxt UI components where appropriate, customize with Tailwind classes
- Include loading states, error boundaries, and accessibility (aria, focus, reduced-motion)
- Use `@theme` in CSS for design tokens instead of hardcoded values
- Every design should be different — vary themes, fonts, and aesthetics
